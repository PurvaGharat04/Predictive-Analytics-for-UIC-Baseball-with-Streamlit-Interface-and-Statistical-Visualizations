Primary goal of this project is to develop a predictive analytics model that can accurately forecast player performances under various conditions. This model will focus on three critical aspects: pitcher performance, batter performance, and live ball-in-play pitching dynamics (LiveBPPitching) from historical pitcher and batter data, focusing on whiff rate, weighted on base percentage, batting average, and slugging percentage, to forecast and assess the performance of baseball players. 

The goal is to provide actionable insights for informed decision-making in team composition, player development, and overall team success. The resulting interactive platform will empower stakeholders to make informed decisions based on the predictive analytics derived from the comprehensive analysis of pitcher and batter data.
